# Radarlens
#### Creator: [Delight Gbolahan Olu-Olagbuji](https://github.com/Dheelyte)

Radarlens is a location-based e-commerce web app built for small businesses.

*It took me 12 months to deploy the current version of Radarlens, which is the most stable version. It took this long mostly because I had to learn some tech stacks as they were needed so as to integrate them into Radarlens.
I initially deployed Radarlens to Heroku, then later redeployed it to AWS, then recently deployed it to render*
