# Radarlens
#### Creator: [Delight Gbolahan Olu-Olagbuji](https://github.com/Dheelyte)

Radarlens is a location-based e-commerce web app built for small businesses.

It took 12 months to finally deploy this current version of Radarlens, which is the most stable version.
I handled the back-end and frontend of the app
